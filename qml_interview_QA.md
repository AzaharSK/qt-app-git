### What is QML, and how does it relate to Qt?

* `Answer:` QML, or Qt Meta-Object Language, is a declarative language for designing user interface-centric applications. 
  It is part of the Qt framework and is used to create UIs in a way that separates the design and logic.

### Explain the basic structure of a QML file.

* `Answer:` A QML file consists of an import statement, a root element, and nested elements.
   The import statement specifies the QML modules used, the root element defines the top-level structure, and nested elements represent the components of the UI.

### What is the purpose of the import statement in QML?

* `Answer:` The import statement is used to include QML modules and make their types available in the current QML document. It allows the usage of predefined QML    types from libraries or modules.

### How does data binding work in QML?
* `Answer:` Data binding in QML allows the automatic propagation of changes from one property to another. When one property changes, the bound property is           automatically updated. This simplifies the management of UI elements and their interactions.

### What is the significance of the Item element in QML?

Answer: The Item element is a basic visual element in QML, serving as a container for other items. It has no inherent visual appearance but provides a way to group and position other visual elements.
How can you handle user input in QML?

Answer: User input in QML is handled through event handlers. You can use MouseArea for handling mouse events, Keys for keyboard events, and other similar elements for touch or other input devices.
Explain the difference between Item and Rectangle elements in QML.

Answer: Both Item and Rectangle are visual elements, but Rectangle is a specialized form of Item with additional properties like color and border. Item is more generic and does not have a visual appearance on its own.
What is the purpose of the Connections element in QML?

Answer: The Connections element is used to connect signals and handlers in QML. It allows you to handle signals from other QML or C++ objects, facilitating communication and interaction between different components.
How can you integrate QML with C++ code?

Answer: QML can be integrated with C++ through Qt's signals and slots mechanism. C++ code can expose objects to QML, and QML can invoke C++ methods or react to signals emitted by C++ objects.
Explain the role of the ListView component in QML.

Answer: ListView is used to display a list of items. It efficiently manages the creation and destruction of item delegates, making it suitable for displaying large sets of data.
